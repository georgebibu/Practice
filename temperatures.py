#You are given an array of integers temperatures where temperatures[i] represents the daily temperatures on the ith day.
#Return an array result where result[i] is the number of days after the ith day before a warmer temperature appears on a future day.
#If there is no day in the future where a warmer temperature will appear for the ith day, set result[i] to 0 instead.
