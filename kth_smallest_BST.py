#Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer k, return the kth smallest value (1-indexed) in the tree.
#A binary search tree satisfies the following constraints:
#The left subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
#The right subtree of every node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
#Both the left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
