#You are given the head of a linked list of length n. Unlike a singly linked list, each node contains an additional pointer random, which may point to any node in the list, or null.

#The original value val of the copied node
#A next pointer to the new node corresponding to the next pointer of the original node
#A random pointer to the new node corresponding to the random pointer of the original node
#Note: None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list.
#Return the head of the copied linked list.
