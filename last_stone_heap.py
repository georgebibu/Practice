#You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] represents the weight of the ith stone.
#We want to run a simulation on the stones as follows:
#At each step we choose the two heaviest stones, with weight x and y and smash them together.
#If x == y, both stones are destroyed.
#If x < y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has new weight y - x.
#Continue the simulation until there is no more than one stone remaining.
#Return the weight of the last remaining stone or return 0 if none remain.

            x = heapq.heappop_max(stones)
            y = heapq.heappop_max(stones)
            if x != y:
                heapq.heappush_max(stones, x - y)
        return stones[0] if stones else 0
