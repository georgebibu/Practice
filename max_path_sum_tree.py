#Given the root of a non-empty binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.
#A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes has an edge connecting them.
#A node can not appear in the sequence more than once. The path does not necessarily need to include the root.
#The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
# Definition for a binary tree node.

#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
